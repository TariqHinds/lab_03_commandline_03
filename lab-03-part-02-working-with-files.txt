books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
Tariq@Debra MINGW64 ~/mtec-1003-lab-03
$ less books/other/pg1232.txt

Tariq@Debra MINGW64 ~/mtec-1003-lab-03
$ more books/other/pg1232.txt
bash: more: command not found

Spacebar moves the text downward and shows off it's contents while q exits the content


==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)

==========
21.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
----------
cat: If it need to see all the content is loaded, then cat is a 100% way to find out
head: If I only need to see the bare minium of content at the top
tail if I need to see the bare minium of content at the bottom
less: To scroll through content (spacebar) less is a viable option. q is to quit
more: If I need to see the contents of a file at once. 


==========
22.  How many lines are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the line count?
----------

Tariq@Debra MINGW64 ~/mtec-1003-lab-03
$ wc -l books/other/pg1232.txt
5063 books/other/pg1232.txt
